#OAuth Tutorial

For me, OAuth used to be a bad word. It seemed to be this giant monster that was to be avoided at all costs. It just didn't make any sense.

However, my goal was to decipher it for myself and present it to the local KC PHP user group. This is that project.

Simply check it out (`git clone https://github.com/JosephMaxwell/OAuth2Implementation.git`), fire up vagrant or MAMP or WAMP, and get coding!

To follow along, enter `git checkout tutorial`. This will give you a shell so you can enter as we go.
